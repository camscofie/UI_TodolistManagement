# UI_TodoListManagement

This repository contains the frontend of the TodoListManagagment.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.
We recommend to use the latest node.js running at least npm 5.8.0.

# Setting up the environment
The following tasks are required to run the frontend. There is no need to use a specific editor for running the frontend.
For frontend work we recommend Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/). It offers a good TypeScript support.

## Installing the required software
A detailed installing guide is provided at the Angular QuickStart page (https://angular.io/guide/quickstart).

(1) Installing Node

Node.js is required to run Angular. Install the latest version (10.0.7) of node (standard: 8.11.3).
The Node installer is available for several operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux and more) is available at (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

(2) Installing Angular CLI

Install Angular via the `npm` command provided by the previous installed node.js.
To install the Angular CLI globally, run `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

(3) Clone the repository

Use `git clone https://bitbucket.org/cm-tm/ui_todolistmanagement.git` to clone the repository to your local folder.

(4) Navigate to the project directory

Use the terminal and navigate to the project directory.

(5) Setting NPM dependencies

Configure the NPM dependencies with `npm install`. Before doing, make sure you are in the project directory (see step 4).

### Running the frontend (repeatable)
(6) Navigate to the project directory.

Run a development server with `ng serve`. The application is running on the pre-defined port `4200`.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`and see if the application is running.

### Troubleshooting
(Not provided yet) If you only see the bare sceleton of the page, you need to run the backend as well.

### Notes
Steps (1) and (2) are only needed to be executed once.
Steps (3) to (5) are neccessary for each angular repository.
Step (6) is for starting the server. If the server is stopped, it can be started with step (6) again.


#Further tips

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
